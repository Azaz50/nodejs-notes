# CRUD API Project Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the CRUD API project found in the `crud-api-project-22` directory.

## Project Overview

This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides endpoints to manage a collection of "students".

### `index.js` File Purpose

The `index.js` file is the main entry point of the application. Its primary responsibilities are:

1.  **Importing Dependencies:** It imports the necessary libraries:
    *   `express`: The web framework for building the API.
    *   `mongoose`: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, used to interact with the database.
    *   `dotenv`: A module to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
    *   `./config/db.js`: A custom module to establish a connection with the MongoDB database.
    *   `./routes/students.route.js`: A module that defines the API routes for student-related operations.

2.  **Database Connection:** It calls the `connectDB()` function from `db.js` to connect to the MongoDB database.

3.  **Middleware Setup:** It configures the following middleware:
    *   `express.urlencoded({ extended: false })`: To parse incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads (form data).
    *   `express.json()`: To parse incoming requests with JSON payloads.
    *   `app.use('/api/students', studentRoutes)`: This mounts the student routes, meaning all routes defined in `students.route.js` will be prefixed with `/api/students`.

4.  **Starting the Server:** It starts the Express server and makes it listen for incoming requests on port 3000.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Project Setup

*   **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install` in your terminal to install all the required packages listed in `package.json`.
*   **Create a `.env` file:** Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the project directory.
*   **Add Environment Variables:** In the `.env` file, add your MongoDB connection string:
    ```
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    ```
    Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your actual MongoDB connection URI.

### 2. Running the Application

*   Run `npm start` or `node index.js` in your terminal to start the server.
*   You should see the message "Server running on port 3000" in your console.

## API Endpoints and Usecase (as seen in screenshots)

The screenshots (`Screenshot (94).png` and `Screenshot (95).png`) likely demonstrate using a tool like Postman to test the API endpoints.

### 1. Get All Students

*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/students`
*   **Purpose:** To retrieve a list of all students from the database.
*   **Screenshot Context:** `Screenshot (94).png` likely shows a `GET` request to this URL and the JSON response containing an array of student objects.

### 2. Create a New Student

*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/students`
*   **Purpose:** To add a new student to the database.
*   **Request Body (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "age": 25
    }
    ```
*   **Screenshot Context:** `Screenshot (95).png` likely shows a `POST` request to this URL with a JSON body similar to the one above. The response would be the newly created student object.

### 3. Get a Single Student

*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/students/:id`
*   **Purpose:** To retrieve a single student by their unique ID.
*   **Example URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/students/60d5f3b4c5a6e42b8c5e9f2a`

### 4. Update a Student

*   **Method:** `PUT` or `PATCH`
*   **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/students/:id`
*   **Purpose:** To update the information of an existing student.
*   **Request Body (JSON):**
    ```json
    {
        "name": "Jane Doe",
        "age": 26
    }
    ```

### 5. Delete a Student

*   **Method:** `DELETE`
*   **URL:** `http://localhost:3000/api/students/:id`
*   **Purpose:** To remove a student from the database.

These endpoints provide a complete set of operations to manage student data, which is a common requirement in many web applications.
